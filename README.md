This project and application was based on the provided LinkedInLearning and PHP Object Oriented learning materials as per the module's request. Notably, the file structure and the file names and file functions was largely based on this learning material. A medium-level amount of the design (especially with simple displaying of webpages and SQL infrastructure) was based on the learning material. All the code has borrowed ideas from the learning material.
